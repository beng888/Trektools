        <p>
        The hiking landscape in the Cordilleras has greatly expanded in the past few years, and among them are a growing number of dayhike possibilities from Baguio City. Among these, by far the most popular has been Mt. Ulap. For those wishing for a more serious dayhike, however – or even a new, relatively-relaxing overnight hike – there’s Mt. Pigingan in Itogon, Benguet, just under the shadow of Mt. Ugo. Though a low-altitude mountain – 1328m – by Cordillera standards, this mountain, which means “slanted” in the local language, nonetheless possesses the elements of a classic hike in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
        The trip to Pigingan takes the hiker the same way to Brgy. Tinongdan, one of the major trailheads of Ugo, but the trip continues for 8 more kilometres to Sitiop Balocloc in Brgy. Dalupirip, making for a total of a 1.5-2-hour jeep or van ride from Baguio City. The hike, which initially courses along the banks of Agno River, heads to a couple other hamlets before proceeding with the hike proper. Because the location of Mt. Pigingan places it close to Pangasinan and the lowlands, expect a warmer-than-usual Cordillera hike especially at the initial sections. There have also been reports of niknik (i.e. gnat or sandfly) bites especially along the riverbanks (although this could be truer during the wet season as the author didn’t encounter any during his hike in January 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
        A junction which doubles as a rest area marks the halfway point; the real ascent to Pigingan proper begins at this stage; there is also the possibility to traverse to Mt. Ugo. If proceeding to Pigingan, the hike is typical Cordillera: village paths – i.e. future roads – that lead to pine forests, refreshing winds, scenic views of the mountains, and occasional cattle encounters. The summit (1328 MASL) is a prominent rocky peak, from which one can view the surrounding semi-barren, semi-pine hills dominated by Ugo,  Binga Dam, and, to the south, the lowlands of Pangasinan.
        </p>
        <p>
        Mt. Pigingan does not reach the grandeur of Pulag or Napulauan nor their lofty elevation, but given its proximity to Baguio City and the fact that it is a more serious hike than Ulap, it is nonetheless a very welcome addition to the Cordillera hiking scene. At the same time, possibilities for a traverse to Mt. Ugo makes it a possible gateway to longer adventures.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
      TRIVIA
      </p>
      <p>
      Mt. Pigingan is very near the “tri-border” of Ilocos Region (Pangasinan), CAR (Benguet), and Cagayan Valley (Nueva Vizcaya).
      </p>
      <p>
      Agno River, which is a prominent part of the Pigingan landscape, is over 200 kms long, originating at the Mount Data area in Benguet and empties into the West Philippine Sea through the  Lingayen Gulf in Pangasinan. There are three dams in Agno: Binga Dam – visible from Pigingan – the very-familiar Ambuklao Dam, and San Roque Dam.

        Notes in the itinerary:<br />
        1. See other transport options below<br />
        2. An even-earlier start is recommended for those who wish to avoid sun overexposure
      </p>
        <h3>
        *With improved road conditions, it is now easier to do a two-day Akiki-Ambangeg Traverse of Mt. Pulag. Leave early from Baguio City and simply follow the itinerary, continuing all the way to the saddle campsite on Day 1. Day 2 would feature the summit and the descent down Ambangeg Trail.
