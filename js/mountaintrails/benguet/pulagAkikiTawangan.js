      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <li class="scroll">
        <p>
          The four classic trails of Mt. Pulag are Ambangeg, Akiki,
          Tawangan, and Ambaguio, and in the course of several hikes I
          have had the privilege of trying all of them. The recent years
          have seen Ambangeg becoming a tourist trail, and with hundreds
          of people on its main campsite during weekends, I think it is
          time to deemphasize the Ambangeg as the ‘main’ Pulag trail.
          Whether we like it or not, because of its easy access to the
          summit, people will flock there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of this itinerary is to introduce a different Mt.
          Pulag experience, one that would appeal more to hikers, but in
          a way that is also doable within a weekend. It will be a
          radically different weekend: the unique trails you will pass
          through will span over 30 kilometers – thrice that of
          Ambangeg. In terms of hiking hours, we will also be looking at
          10-hour days apiece, instead of the 8-hour total of Ambangeg.
          In terms of difficulty, I would give the Akiki-Tawangan a 7/9
          compared to the 3/9 of Ambangeg.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I speak of is the Akiki-Tawangan Traverse, a very scenic
          and challenging hike that combines the the steep,
          pine-forested trail of Akiki and the long, mossy-forested
          trail of Tawangan, and between them, the grassland summit –
          providing a Pulag experience that has instantly become one of
          my favorite Cordillera hikes!
        </p>
        <p>
          The Akiki-Tawangan is also combinable with a Mt. Tabayoc
          dayhike on the third day, making this a much more exciting
          option than the Luzon 3-2-1, which involves visiting Mt.
          Timbak. Although Timbak is a nice place, in terms of trekking
          hours, I am convinced that an Akiki-Tawangan-Tabayoc is a more
          reasonable option.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first part of the hike involves ascending to the summit
          via the Akiki Trail, which can be accomplished in one long
          day, or two relaxed ones. The advantage of pushing Akiki Trail
          in one day is that it makes a “weekend Pulag” possible with
          the help of chartered jeepneys. On the other hand, by creating
          a four-day itinerary, availing of passenger buses on both ends
          is very possible. Overall, I would suggest a 3 or 4-day hike;
          with an optional Tabayoc, time permitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The steep ascent requires an altitude gain of over 1500 meters
          and it is not recommended for people who will not enjoy such a
          demanding task for one day. Options include camping in Eddet
          River, or more reasonably, Marlboro Country which has a water
          source and is close enough to the summit to reach it early in
          the morning. There is nothing complicated about the Akiki
          Trail: It’s just ascents and pine trees all the way!
        </p>
        <p>
          Past Marlboro Country, you will enter a mossy forest but this
          is not the mossy forest awaiting you in the hike. 2.5-3 hours
          from Marlboro, you will emerge into the grassland summit area
          of Pulag and within 30 minutes you will be at the summit.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the summit, the Tawangan Trail is a very long but gradual
          descent through a mesmerizing mossy forest. If the Akiki is
          pine forest all the way, the Tawangan is mostly mossy, and
          this will go on for 7-9 hours on a descent. The only
          perceptible change is the increase in height of the trees as
          you descent – a natural consequence of varying climatic
          factors. Two-thirds into the trail, you will trek parallel to
          the Halong Creek, which doubles as a water source. When the
          descent is done, the village of Tawangan – with its friendly
          people and cozy and cheap lodge – is not far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the peakbagger, climbing Mt. Tabayoc, Luzon’s second
          highest, is very appealing since it is just a 3 or 4-hour
          return hike. This entails an additional day, but also makes
          the itinerary more relaxed.
        </p>

      <h1>PRACTICALITIES</h1>
      <li class="scroll">
        <p>When to go. Mt. Pulag is accessible throughout the year, but it is much more advisable to climb it during the early months of the year, for many reasons. Bad weather, for instance, may not allow the jeep to reach the Ranger Station. Also, clouds may very well obscure the fabled Pulag views, which may lead to disappointment. Moreover, rainy conditions would make it even colder. Thus the advisable time frame for Pulag is between December-early May. However, Pulag may be climbed year round and if you’re lucky you can have nice weather even in the so-called typhoon months of June to September.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Getting there. From Manila, Baguio is a 5-6 hour ride by bus; Victory Liner has hourly night trips (P460) as well as an option to take a three-across bus (P700-800). From Baguio, if you have a lot of time in your hands you can take the public bus to Kabayan (P150) that leaves at the Dangwa Terminal. If you wish to do the two-day or three-day options, it is best to charter a jeepney.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: 500;">Registration and guides. The other contact is the DENR Park Superintendent for the Mt. Pulag National Park, Emerita Albas. She may be reached at +639196315402. She will contact the guides ahead of time. The Akiki-Tawangan itinerary is not included in their official list of guide fees, so you can negotiate a bit. For the two-day itinerary, I paid P2000 per guide. Mrs. Albas asked us to get two guides for security reasons, but as this itinerary is used more often, I think she will agree to just one guide for up to 7 persons. </p>
        <h3>
          Camping notes. There are water sources in Eddet River campsite (obviously) and near the Marlboro country, and in the distal portions of the Tawangan Trail. Cellphone signal exists in many parts of the Akiki Trail but the Tawangan area has limited signal.
