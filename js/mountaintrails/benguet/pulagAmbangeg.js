        <p>
        Majestic Mt. Pulag is highest peak in Luzon and one of the most beautiful mountains in the Philippines. Its fabled views, of winding slopes of dwarf bamboo, and distant peaks surging like islets in the ocean of lofty clouds, comprise perhaps the most breathtaking sights in Philippine mountaineering. The native tribes say that Mt. Pulag is the “playground of the gods”. In Luzon, it is literally the closest to heaven that mountaineers can get!
        </p>
        <p>
        The enchantment of Pulag, however, is much greater than just the clouds and dwarf bamboo. The entire experience is a great treat that makes the long travel time (10 hours from Manila to Baguio then Baguio to the jump-off) worth it. Whichever trail you choose – the easy Ambangeg, the challenging Akiki, the arduous Vizcaya trail, or the various traverse climbs – Pulag is a great adventure. Of course, many would opt to do different trails in one climb, the most common of which is the Akiki-Ambangeg combination.When you climb Mt. Pulag, you would already start off on a high altitude. The cool weather is refreshing, but if you are not prepared the weather will become a great burden because temperatures have been recorded to reach zero or subzero levels. But with proper preparation, the cold weather is quite an experience. Pine trees are everywhere, and you will encounter villages of the Kankaney, Kalanguya, and Ibaloi tribes. Their children are very cute, and bear a resemblance to the other mountain peoples of the world. Their main livelihood is agriculture; you will pass through sloped plots of cabbages, lettuce, potataos, and other crops that ultimately find their way in Baguio’s famed markets. Bear in mind that the region is the ‘Salad Bowl’ of the Philippines.
        </p>
        <p>
        THE TRAILS OF MT. PULAG
The map illustrates the approximate locations of each trail, as well as its path, in relation with the summit of Mt. Pulag. The Ambangeg Trail is discussed in this main article. Visit also the Akiki Trail and the Tawangan Trail.
        </p>
        <p>
        THE AMBANGEG TRAIL
It is very convenient to make arrangements for jeepneys from Baguio to take you directly to the Badabak Ranger Station. This significantly cuts climbing time, and it makes possible a 2-day Pulag climb. If you arrive early in the morning in Baguio, you can take the jeep and be at the Ranger Station by lunchtime.
        </p>
        <p>
        From the Ranger Station to the summit is around 8 kms. First you will pass by wide trails, surrounded by pine trees and picturesque landscape. After awhile, you will enter the montane forest, with its grand spectrum of flora – from the pink flowers known locally as ayusep (see photo) and various mosses to the archaic, bonsai-shaped trees. The next landmark in the middle of the mossy forest is Camp 1, marked by a hut.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the entirety of the trek to the grassland, there’s only one moderately steep part, taking just a few hundred steps. Actually the trail is very relaxing and enjoyable, with the cool weather and the encounter of various faces of the mountain (pine trees, montane forest, grassland). At the montane forest, you will catch the first glimpse of the Pulag summit, which has a hue of golden brown.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are a few campsites to choose from: Camp 1 is still within the mossy forest area; in Camp 2 the grassland is just beginning (2600+ MASL). There is also another campsite which goes beyond the summit, on the way to the Akiki trail. This is the saddle campsite (Camp 3) and is preferred by those who want close proximity to the summit. Camp 2 is the most advisable campsite, with a close water source, latrines, nice views, and more manageable weather conditions. However, the saddle campsite, being very the near the summit, takes you as close to the sky as possible. Either way, brace yourself! Temperatures can really plummet to near-freezing levels.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ranger Station to Campsite 2 takes around 3 hours. From this camp, the summit assault is typically done either late afternoon (for the sunset) and very early morning (for the sunrise). The trail beyond this point is offers unparalleled grassland landscapes, with the grand array of the Cordillera mountains as backdrop. The dwarf bamboo grass that envelope the slopes is a wondrous presence. After an hour of trekking, you will finally reach the summit, that is, the highest point in Luzon.
        </p>
        <p>
        The summit views of Pulag are fabled and legendary. On a blessed time, seas of clouds form beneath, covering everything but the highest points in the Cordilleras: Mt. Amuyao rises very distinctly northeast, then the twin Mts. Kapiligan and Napulauan (NNE). The picture on the left shows the blogger’s hands at Amuyao (L) and Napulauan (R). Mt. Tabayoc (N) and Pulag is separated by Mt. Panotoan (N). Then moving your eyes westward, you will see the the mountains of Tenglawan and Kibungan (NW), and you will also appreciate Mt. Timbak (WNW), said to be the Luzon’s third highest point. The range from which Mt. Timbak rises is one where the Halsema highroad, the Philippines’ highest highway, passes. In this range one can also see Mt. Pawoi (W). Beyond this, further west, is already the Ilocos region. Baguio City and Mt. Sto. Tomas continue the visual circle (WSW) and if the sea of clouds is lower than 2100 MASL, you can also see Mt. Ugu (S). These are objective sights to see, but the subjective feeling of being there, above the clouds, is hard to put in words. How beautiful exactly? One has to go to Pulag in order to find out.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">
      TRIVIA
      </p>
      <p>There used to be a dog named Chica which guides mountaineers up the mountain. In 2003, when the blogger first climbed Mt. Pulag, Chica followed all the way to the summit. It was a chillingly cold November. For full story, see the feature on Chica.</p>
      <p>
      Parts of Mt. Pulag are claimed as “ancestral domains” of the different tribes, such as the Kankaney, Ibaloi, and Kalanguya tribes. The guides and porters belong to these indigenous communities.</p>

        Note: It is also possible to take regular public transport to the Visitors’ Center but it will be difficult to manage a two-day itinerary since the bus would arrive in the afternoon and this would still necessitate taking a motorcycle to the Ranger Station. However, this is very possible with a three-day itinerary.

        <h3>
        ADDITIONAL NOTES
        </h3>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Scheduling</p>
        <p>
        Mt. Pulag is accessible throughout the year, but it is much more advisable to climb it during the early months of the year, for many reasons. Bad weather, for instance, may not allow the jeep to reach the Ranger Station. Also, clouds may very well obscure the fabled Pulag views, which may lead to disappointment. Moreover, rainy conditions would make it even colder. Thus the advisable time frame for Pulag is between December-early May. However, Pulag may be climbed year round and if you’re lucky you can have nice weather even in the so-called typhoon months of June to September.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Facilities</p>
        <p>
        You can take a bath or rinse either at the Ranger Station or the Visitors’ Center. There are latrines in Camp 2, and a water source is also present in the mossy forest just before the grassland. Cellphone signal exists in many parts of the trail, including the ranger station, the campsite, and the summit. Tents (limited availability) may also be rented from the park.
	</p>
        <hr>
        <p style="font-weight: bold">Environmental concerns</p>
        <p>	
        There are growing concerns about the sustainability of the ecotourism activities in Mt. Pulag, with many pointing out that the current influx of weekend hikers exceed the carrying capacity of the mountain. To reduce impact on Mt. Pulag, PinoyMountaineer suggests avoiding camping in the weekends or peak seasons such as the Holy Week, or minimizing group number to 15 or fewer (with 30 as upper limit). This suggestion is also for the hikers’ sake: you may not enjoy a campsite full of people. For serious hikers, the less-trodden Akiki, Tawangan, Ambaguio trail, or the Ugo-Pulag Traverse (as part of the proposed Grand Cordillera Trail) may be more rewarding encounters with the outdoors. Moreover, PinoyMountaineer does not advice would-be visitors of Mt. Pulag to patronize organizers who do not regulate their number of participants.
