        The Akiki trail is a more challenging route to Mt. Pulag, dubbed as the “Killer Trail” by mountaineers because of its steep slopes. It requires 10-11 hours to reach the summit from this trail, whose up-and-down paths pass by Eddet River (2 hours) where one can camp, rest, and bathe, and continuing across steep, scenic pine-covered slopes to what is dubbed as Marlboro Country (4-hours), so-called because its brown, wide landscapes evoke those seen in the cigarette commercials. Just like the other trails to Pulag, this trail would then pass by the montane forest (3 hours) until reach the grassland area. After the challenging trek, the summit views are rewarding, and the saddle campsite affords a closer access to the summit, being just 15 minutes away.
        </p>
        <p>
        The name of the trail is onomatopeiac in origin, derived from the small brids whose high-pitched chirped sounds like “Aki-ki-ki…”. It is unsurprising that this trail would be named after a bird call, because Mt. Pulag is a bird sanctuary, home to 143 species of birds. Rare species include the whiskered pitta (Pitta koctri) and the Luzon water-redstart (Rhyacomis bicolor).

        TRIVIA
           </p>
           <p>
           There are two schools of thought as to the origin of Mt. Pulag’s name: Some say it is derived from the Ibaloi word ‘pulag’ means ‘to fall down’, reflecting its towering height. Others believe it is from the the Kalanguya word ‘napulogan’ which means bald – referring to its treeless grassland summit. Either way, it is a sacred ground to the locals of the region, to the locals of the region. Animism (worship of natural objects such as trees, animals) still exists in some areas in Benguet, and they believe that ancestral spirits roam in the mountain. This gives rise to Pulag’s being called the “Playground of the gods”.
           <p/>
           <p>
           For those seeking a greater challenge, it is possible to do a three-day Akiki-Ambaguio Traverse, combining the steepest (Akiki) and longest (Ambaguio) trails of Luzon’s highest mountain! This Pulag Crossover was done by the blogger in December 2010 and is narrated in Hiking matters 115-117. The blogger also did a two-day Akiki-Tawangan Traverse in 2012.

        *With improved road conditions, it is now easier to do a two-day Akiki-Ambangeg Traverse of Mt. Pulag. Leave early from Baguio City and simply follow the itinerary, continuing all the way to the saddle campsite on Day 1. Day 2 would feature the summit and the descent down Ambangeg Trail.
