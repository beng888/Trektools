    The summit of Tirad Peak is barely enough for five persons. The views are spectacular.

    <h3>TRIVIA</h3>
    <p>
    Tirad Peak and Tirad Pass served as the venue for the 2nd PinoyMountaineer Annual Charity Climb on February 6-7, 2010. A medical mission was held prior to the climb. The theme color was green and the climb comprised of 62 participants, including delegates from ONE Degree Mountaineering Group (ODMG) from Laoag, Ilocos Norte who provided us with invaluable assistance.

      <h1>BACKGROUND</h1>
      <li class="scroll">
        <p>
        An exciting new destination in the Ilocos Region is Tirad Peak, which towers above the historical trail of Tirad Pass. Virtually unknown to mountaineers and deemed unreachable by locals, PinoyMountaineer.com coordinated with the Tourism Board of Gregorio del Pilar town (GDP) in a series of explorations that ultimately led to the first major climb up the summit on occasion of the 2nd PinoyMountaineer Annual Charity Climb in February 7-8, 2010. With the trails now established, it is possible to visit Tirad Pass and Tirad Peak in one trip – combining a scenic, historical trail with a challenging and very rewarding peak to conquer.
        </p>
        <p>
        This trek starts from the Poblacion of GDP, or you can also ask your jeepney to take you closer to the traihead of the Tirad Pass trail. It was called ‘Old Spanish Trail’ because it was used during Spanish times as a major gateway to the Cordilleras. It was sufficiently wide for horses to pass; hence the “Battle Above the Clouds” could be fought there. Along the way, references to the historic battle could be found. You can rest at the cave where del Pilar slept the night before he was slain in the battle. Closer to the Tirad Pass Shrine, which also serves as the campsite, there is a “Lonely Trail” that leads to the “Sniper’s Knoll” which was allegedly the spot where the American sniper that shot del Pilar to death was stationed.
        </p>
        <p>
        The campsite itself is scenic. Facing west one can behold the plains of Ilocos Sur and South China Sea beyond; the breezes are cool and wide campsite can accommodate a large group. The Shrine which features the valiant ‘Boy General’ mounted on a horse, makes for nice photo-ops.
The next day, an early morning assault up the summit is recommended. It takes 4-5 hours to reach Tirad Peak on light packs. This time, you will follow the Americans in the trail took to catch up with the escaping Philippine Army, according to history books guided by the traitor Januario Galut. The woodlands are at times winding, for most part unremarkable, but once you begin to see a towering Tirad Peak ahead of you, the excitement begins.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the foot of Tirad Peak, the trail begins to be very steep. The trail is rocky, and some bouldering is required to reach the peak. Tirad Peak calls to mind Pico de Loro in terms of the peak’s contours; whereas it is also reminiscent of Batulao in terms of the grassy terrain, and the steep, 150-meter assault. The sweeping views culminate at the pinnacle, which enables you to view sections of Ilocos Sur, Abra, and Benguet. The vast panorama is breathtaking. Truly, Tirad Peak is another good reason to climb in the North!

        <h3>Transportation</h3>
        <p>It is possible to rent a jeepney from Candon to GDP or vice versa, but the rental cost is quite expensive (P1800/way). The much cheaper alternative, especially for small groups, is to adjust the itinerary according to the regular jeepney trips. Jeepneys leave Candon to GDP at around 1300H daily, and they return to GDP at 0700H, daily as well (P75 either way).
        </p>
        <p>
        Importantly, it is possible to merge a Tirad Peak assault with a Tirad Pass traverse to Sagada. One can interrupt the traverse at Quirino town (the end of Tirad Pass trail proper). From Quirino, there are trips to San Fernando, La Union; Candon; and nearby towns: they likewise leave early in the morning.
        Logistics. It is best to coordinate your trip first with the tourism officer of GDP, Mr. Macario Burgos. He may be contacted at +639265331076. There is a registration fee of P25/person for the park. U
        Cellphone signal is present in most parts of the trail.
